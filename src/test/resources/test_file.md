# Documentation and Coding for Patient Safety Indicators

**What is this tool?**The purpose of this tool is to facilitate improvements to documentation and coding processes to ensure that PSI rates are accurate. The tool has two sections. The first describes procedures to address problems with documentation and coding practices among providers and hospital staff. The second illustrates some of the issues that can arise when documenting and coding each PSI. 

**Who are the target audiences?**The primary audiences for this tool are providers, clinical documentation improvement specialists, coders, and quality officers.All of them have roles in coding diagnoses and procedures from medical records, which will be used to calculate PSI incidence rates.

**How can this tool help you?**By using this tool, stakeholders should gain a better understanding of how documentation and coding can affect PSI rates.They also will learn about actions they can take to estimate their PSI rates more accurately.Efforts to improve documentation and coding accuracy can reduce variability in data, increase confidence in the PSI rates, and help identify areas where improvements can be made in both measurement and care processes.

**How does this tool relate to the others?**This tool should be used in conjunction with the other tools for applying quality indicators (QIs) to hospital data (B tools).After you calculate your hospital’sPSI rates, you can assess their validity by examining how accurately providers document diagnoses, procedures, events, and related issues.You also can look at how accurately these items were coded for use in quality measurement and billing processes.

**When ICD-9[footnoteRef:2] becomes ICD-10.**All of the information provided in this documentation and coding tool is based on use of the ICD-9-CM codes for calculating PSI incidence rates.When the ICD-10 codes become the standard for the U.S. health care system, AHRQ will revise the definitions of the PSIs to conform to the new codes.New coding issues will likely arise as hospitals start to work with the revised PSIs.This tool will need to be revised at that time, to be consistent with the new PSI definitions and to provide guidance regarding relevant documentation and coding issues.

# Addressing the Documentation and Coding Process

The documentation and coding process is the transformation of narrative descriptions of diseases, injuries, and healthcare procedures into numeric or alphanumeric designations (that is, code numbers). The code numbers are detailed to accurately describe the diagnoses (what is wrong with the patient) and the procedures performed to test or treat these diagnoses. 

Policymakers are placing greater emphasis on quality performance and expect hospitals to report on clinical care measures.Therefore, hospitals are now focusing both on coding for appropriate reimbursement and coding for accurate quality measurement and reporting.

The documentation and coding issues and suggested actions discussed in this section are relevant not only for coding of medical information for the PSIs but also for a hospital’s entire documentation and coding process.In the following section, issues specific to the PSIs are discussed, including issues and actions specific to each PSI.

Coders must use the documentation provided by physicians and other providers, in compliance with coding regulations, to establish the codes for each inpatient stay.To achieve accurate coding, providers need to understand the coding process and the rules that must be followed to ensure coding objectivity.[footnoteRef:3]Providers should use consistent language and specific diagnostic terms to document clinical careand to provide the complete information needed for accurate coding.Also needed is a well-established process through which clinical documentation improvement (CDI) specialists and coders can query physicians to resolve questions or issues (Preskitt, 2005; Ballentine,2009; Orcutt 2009).

In summary, effective documentation and coding involveprocesses involve the following key steps:

* *Documentation*:Establish documentation criteria for providers, including specific diagnostic terms that are consistent with clinical definitions and compliant with coding regulations.
* *Coding*:Establish coding criteria for conditions or events using the documentation from providers, and offer training on using these criteria.
* *Query process*:Establish an effective process that CDI specialists and coders can use to obtain clarification from physicians on documentation issues that may affect the coding process.
## Documentation by Providers

Because coders can use only documentation that complies with coding regulations, physicians and other providers need to understand coding requirements and learn to consistently document using appropriate terminology. Theyneed to document diagnoses, conditions, symptoms, and procedures using the following practices: 

* Avoid abbreviations and symbols.
* Write complete SOAP (subjective, objective, assessment, and plan) notes.
* Become familiar with rules and concepts of documentation and coding.
* Be accurate and comprehensive.
* Document a thorough history and physical.
* Document the outcomes of “ruleout,” “consider,” and “possible” diagnoses.
* Identify the principal diagnosis.
* Include all secondary diagnoses and conditions.
## Expert Coding

Coders should be encouraged and empowered to focus on the quality of coding, not just productivity.It is important to take the time to ensure that the coded record is an accurate representation of the patient’s clinical condition and treatment. Clinical documentation specialists and coders should make careful queries to providers to clarify documentation when needed.Hospitals have found that the following issues have been sources of coding errors: 

* Incomplete or inadequate provider documentation.
* Incorrect principal diagnosis selection, such as: 
    * Coding a condition when a complication code should have been used.
    * Coding a symptom or sign rather than a diagnosis.
    * Assuming a diagnosis without definitive documentation of a condition.
    * Coding only from the discharge summary and not the complete medical record.
    * Incorrectly applying the coding guidelines for principal diagnosis, especially when two or more diagnoses equally meet the definition of principal diagnosis. 
* Incorrect or missing comorbidities or complications.
* Incorrect present on admission (POA) assignment.
* Limitation of coding to the Medicare Severity diagnosis-related group (MS-DRG) (i.e., not coding the full record because reimbursement will not change with additional codes).
* Incorrect MS-DRG assignment.
* Encoder errors or incorrect encoder pathway.
* Incorrect memorization of diagnosis and procedure codes.
## Query Process

Queries may be generated whenever the medical record lacks codable documentation or information is missing, conflicting, ambiguous, or illegible.It is important to have a well-defined query process to ensure that your clinical documentation specialists and coders can effectively obtain needed information without leading the provider and upcoding the information.A sample query form is provided below that might be used in that process.Hospitals may choose to form a CDI team consisting of trained nurses and other specialists that concurrently reviews charts and queries providers to clarify documentation prior to discharge. 

Although coders usually cannot use documentation from nurses and allied health professionals, their notes often provide clues to issues that the physician may have failed to document.Hospitals should consider coordinating nurses’ notes with provider documentation, especially for PSIs for which nurses’ notes are known to be a good source of information (e.g., pressure ulcers).

**SAMPLE QUERY FORM**

Patient Name:

MR#

Date of Hospital Stay:

RE: Documentation Clarification

Dr.:

I am in the process of reviewing this chart for coding.While reviewing the record, I noted on the operative report that no complication was noted in the dictated discharge summary. 

Was the __________________________

[]an incidental occurrence inherent to the surgical procedure or 

[]a complication of the procedure?

Could you please respond by ___________________?Thank you so much for your assistance in getting the medical record accurately coded.

**This query and your response will become part of the patient’s legal medical record and is to be considered an extension of the progress note.**

## Clinical Documentation Improvement

Many hospitals have implemented a CDI program to successfully enhance the quality of clinical data. The essential steps for achieving an effective CDI program are described in the *UHC Clinical Documentation Challenges 2009 Field Book*:

* Hire and train expert clinical documentation specialists to conduct concurrent chartreview and clarify documentation before discharge.
* Educate providers aboutthe need to partner with CDI staff to ensure the accuracy of performance data.
* Implement practices that support documentationimprovement, such as a query process, education,tools and aids, and expert coding.
* Hold providers accountable for compliancewith documentation requirements (e.g., financial incentives,recredentialing criteria,suspension, and peer review).
* Benchmark documentation and coding performanceand communicate the results.
* Recognize and reward good performance.
Hospitals have successfully used a variety of structures for their CDI program, depending on their specific needs and cultures.Some approaches that have been successfully used by CDI programs to promote comprehensive documentation and accurate data include (UHC, 2010): 

* Focus on units or services with poor performance data (e.g., elevated mortality index, high PSI rates).
* Track and communicate documentation query response rates by provider. 
* Implement user-friendly query response methods (e.g., electronic queries linked to the medical record and documentation resources).
* Query for secondary diagnoses, comorbidities, complications, and risk-adjustment factors even when the additional codes will not change reimbursement.
* Review all deaths (e.g., patients who died with a low risk of mortality) to uncover improvement opportunities for documentation and coding and safe, high-quality clinical care. 
## Specific Strategies for Successful Documentation and Coding 

The following set of strategies to improve coding processes have been delineated (Ballantine, 2009; UHC, 2009):

* Educational initiatives for clinical documentation specialists and coders:
    * Introductory didactic presentationson the PSIs and how their rates are calculated.
    * Online tutorial: documentation and coding.
    * Periodic memos with coding tips (“Tip of the Month”).
    * Comprehensive online references and coding tips.
    * Posters, announcements, and branding.
* Provider support services:
    * Introductory didactic presentations on the PSIs and how their rates are calculated.
    * Training on documentation and coding and how theycan affect the hospital.
    * Intranet site with referencesandfrequently asked questions.
    * Clinical documentation improvement liaisons.
    * Electronic health record offering on-demand documentation assistance.
    * Direct contact with clinical documentation specialists and coders.
    * Feedback associated with analysis of performance data and query results.
    * Physician champions or dedicated physician documentation and coding specialists.
* Nursing support services:
    * Educationfor nursing staff on what the PSIs are and on ways they can help prevent them.
    * Presentation of a focus topic each month with suggestions to prevent patient safety events.
    * Guidance on information to include in nursing notes, for incorporation into provider records as appropriate, to document diagnoses, procedures, and related issues.
* CDI team and coding department changes:
    * Adequate staffing with expert CDI staff and coders.
    * Ongoing training and education for CDI specialists and coders.
    * Standing documentation and coding committee.
    * Internal and external audits of documentation and coding accuracy.
## Training

Training for providers, clinical documentation specialists, and coders is essential to respond to changing expectations for accurate coding of clinical conditions and quality measures.Training also helps promote mutual understanding of clinical and coding terminology.

Provider buy-in is critical for effective documentation and coding, which can be encouraged through careful education, administrative support, and physician champions.It also is important to hold providers accountable for compliance with documentation expectations and timely query responsiveness. To get buy-in, you can provide handouts (such as the fact sheets in this toolkit [Tools A1a and A1b] and information about ICD-9 codes and how they are applied), pocket guides, and electronic health record alerts with coding terminology and frequently asked questions. Hospitals may want to make clinical documentation specialists available to provide real-time chart review, provider clarification, and one-on-one education. 

One effective method for gaining buy-in from providers for documentation improvement is to present PSI rates based on their current style of documentation, side by side with revised rates after documentation clarification. This type of presentation highlights the consequences of inadequate documentation and the importance of standardization and clarification. 

The hospital may also need to upgrade the skills of clinical documentation and coding staff.Coding errors may be due to a lack of knowledge of coding principles and terminology, or due to unfamiliarity with changing coding requirements. The quality of staff’s initial training, as well as their ability to stay abreast of current guidelines, is fundamental to their expertise.

## Ways ToEstablish an Effective Coding Communication and Review Process

The hospital can build a foundation for an accurate and comprehensive coding process by establishing written coding compliance policies that provide instructions on the entire process, from point of service to billing or claim forms. The American Health Information Management Association has published a coding compliance document that lays out a set of suggested protocols to include in an organization’s policies (AHIMA, 2012). This document is a useful guide for developing hospital documentation and codingpolicy, which would include a standard process for the management of documentation, queries, coding, and ongoing quality assurance.

Other useful resources are existing policies and procedures established by hospitals or health systems.The following examples of coding policies and procedures are available on the Internet:

# Actions To Code Patient Safety Events Accurately

A number of issues during both the documentation and coding processes can affect the validity of the PSIs. The ***positive predictive value (PPV)*** is an assessment of how accurately the measurement (i.e., the reported PSI rate) reflects the occurrence of actual events. The formula for PPV is:

Positive Predictive Value (PPV) = True Positives / Flagged Cases

The ideal value for PPV is equal to 1, where the number of true positives is equal to the number of flagged cases.If the number of true positives is lower than the number of flagged cases *(PPV < 1)* (e.g., individualswere coded as having a patient safety event when no event actually occurred), there is a problem with *false positives*.

On the other hand, the problem may be one of missed cases that should have been detected, which would result in the number of true positives being higher than the number of flagged cases.Missed cases are more difficult to address than false positives, because they are present in cases that were not identified for calculating PSI rates.Finding missed cases requires a new review of the relevant cases (in the rate denominator) for evidence of events that previously had not been detected.

## Reasons for False Positives 

Several key reasons for false positives in the PSI rates have been identified by hospitals and reported in the health care literature.These include coding of POA, miscoding, lack of coding specificity, coding of nonelective surgical admissions, and inaccurate coding of history of events.

**Present on admission.**One of the most frequently cited causes of false positive cases is improper use of the POA flag (Glance, et al., 2008). Most PSIs have a coding exception that removes cases that arrived at the hospital with a condition that would be coded as a patient safety event had it occurred during the patient’s stay (see Table 2). If POA is not indicated in the documentation or is not properly coded, the PSI rate will be inflated (Houchens, et al., 2008).

Improper use of the POA flag is a particular problem for hospitals that receive many transfers from other institutions.When the clinical conditions are unclear, it is appropriate for the provider to document “rule out,” “possible,” or “consider” diagnoses as long as he or she thoroughly documents the resolution of these tentative conditions in the medical record. 

**Miscoding.**Diagnosis or procedure codes can be miscoded by either assigning an incorrect code or omitting a code, which may also lead to inflated PSI rates.One example of miscoding is to code intentional procedures such as laceration of plaque as an accidental puncture or laceration (PSI 15). 

**Lack of coding specificity.**If documentation or codes are not specific enough, rates can be inflated.For example, rates will be inflated if an event occurs after admission but prior to surgery and there is no documentation or code to indicate that the event was not postoperative. This issue is especially important for the following PSIs:

* PSI 4: (Death Among Surgical Inpatients With Serious Treatable Complications) requires precise coding of complex comorbidities; variation in clinical documentation and coding practices can bias rates of this PSI (Talsma, et al., 2008; Rosen, et al., 2006). 
* PSIs 7 and 13 (Central Venous Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection [CLABSI] and Postoperative Sepsis), a physician may write, “consider sepsis,” which may trigger coders to code “sepsis” despite the lack of evidence of a confirmed infection. Again, it is appropriate for a provider to document tentative conditions and complications as long as he or she follows through to document the confirmation or exclusion of these conditions. 
* PSI 9 (Postoperative Hemorrhage or Hematoma) is sometimes miscoded when a hemorrhage or hematoma occurs during the operation rather than after the operation. 
Another example of lack of coding specificity is a bias against coding chronic conditions or comorbiditiesfor patients who die (Iezzoni, et al., 1992).The rate for PSI 2, Death in Low Mortality DRG, is especially vulnerable to this effect.A lack of codes for comorbidities may distort its rate by including cases in the denominator that should not be there, which likely would increase the PSI rate. Hospitals should establish effective mortality review procedures to assess both the quality and safety of clinical care and the accuracy and completeness of clinical documentation and coding.

**Nonelectivesurgical admission.**Several of the surgical PSIs are only applicable to elective surgeries. These are PSI 10: Postoperative Physiologic and Metabolic Derangement; PSI 11: Postoperative Respiratory Failure; and PSI 13: Postoperative Sepsis. If a patient safety event occurs after a nonelective surgery, this case may be mistakenly included in the rate and would incorrectly inflate the rate.

**History of event.**Finally, coders may mistakenly code physicians’ documentation of “history of” an event as an actual event, which will inflate PSI rates. For example, physicians may write “rule out” pneumothorax, which may be mistakenly coded as a pneumothorax (Romano, 2010).

## Reasons for Missed Cases

Finding missed cases in PSI measurements may be much more difficult than finding false positives. Several of the reasons listed above (especially miscoding and lack of specificity) may bias results in a downward direction.For example, missed cases could occur if an accidental laceration is not clearly documented in the medical record or if cases with sepsis are not identified due to incomplete review of the record.

Hospital quality staff who are interested in finding missed cases may need to come up with creative solutions for finding them. One example would be to inspect laboratory documentation of infections to search for missed line infections. Another would be to audit charts to find missed cases, especially those of high-risk patients (e.g.,longlength of stay, ICU populations who may be at risk for pressure ulcers or CLABSI, deaths, patients with “age extremes”).

## Documentation and Coding Issues for Individual PSIs

Some specific documentation issues for each PSI are listed in Table 1, and some specific coding issues for each PSI are listed in Table 2.The PSIs are grouped as Surgical PSIs, Medical and Surgical PSIs, and Obstetric PSIs.These issues were identified through a search of published papers on PSI measurement issues as well as from feedback from hospitals during field testing of this toolkit and subsequent development of this tool.
